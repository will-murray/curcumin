# ClueGO Python Client & Pathway Enrichment Analysis

## Overview
This project has two primary goals:
1. **Pathway Enrichment Analysis** – I am using Cytoscape + ClueGO to identify enriched biological pathways from gene lists. The objective of the analysis is to identify the pathways affected by curcumin treated cells
2. **ClueGO Python Client** – I am writing a Python interface to the ClueGO[1] app to make it easier to automate analysis with the ClueGO REST API.
